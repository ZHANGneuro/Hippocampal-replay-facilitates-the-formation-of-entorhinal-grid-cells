# Hippocampal-replay-facilitates-the-formation-of-entorhinal-grid-cells
by Bo Zhang and Jia Liu


The phenomenon of neuronal replay, the sequential reactivation of hippocampal place cells for past experiences, have been proposed to organize learned knowledges into a cognitive map. Here we used the spin-glass model to simulate the formation of the hexagonal pattern of grid cells, the metric of cognitive map, when exploring novel environments under the influence of neuronal replay. We found a significant enhancement of grid periodicity particularly in smaller grid scales after the application of reverse replay. This suggests that reversed replay plays a role in constructing a high-resolution cognitive map by expanding the horizon in reverse directions, thereby capturing the global structure of the environment. In conclusion, our study highlights the directional attribute of reverse replay in the formation of the cognitive map through facilitating grid cells’ hexagonal patterns in the entorhinal–hippocampus system.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5019040/219922477-bc215255-556e-41ba-b630-01edc9648b02.png)
