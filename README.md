# `I am building the repository now! `<br />



The repository collects the code of python for grid cell simulation and .NET code for virtual navigation simulation as used in the manuscript entitled "Hippocampal replay facilitates the formation of entorhinal grid cells" in bioRxiv.

This work shows the significant effect of reversed neuronal replay in facilitating the pattern formation of grid cells with smaller scales underlying the simulation of spin-glass model. The finding may suggest the role of reverse replay in constructing a high-resolution cognitive map.


## My programming environment for grid cell simulation:
python 3.9.16
pytorch 1.13.1
umap-learn 0.5.3


We found a significant enhancement of grid periodicity particularly in smaller grid scales after the application of reverse replay.
